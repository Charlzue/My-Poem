For my dear hubby, my Angelo <3
143, Hubby <3

Original Haiku (5-7-5):
Couldn't express love
But deep down is full of words
I love you, my hubby

Reversed Haiku (7-5-7):
I am not a showy guy
But know I love you
You're always my forever

Free Verse Poem:
I find it hard to show and express my love to my hubby
Sometimes I appear cold and snobbish
Probably it's just my personality and nature
But if I am to tell what my heart is saying,
It's pure, it's real, it's love, it's you and I
